### Changelog - 2022.03.20

- Testing using `itemize` and `enumerate` rather than tabulars, currently copied start up section for comparison
- Also testing new style of table for `TSD POINT - ADD`
  - `textwidth` to define section widths
  - no `textbullet` when enumeration unnecessary
  - removed center vertical line to free up additional horizontal space

  - `Communication / Datalink`
  - `Defensive Systems / ASE`
  - `Sensors` 
  - `Weapons`

  - Notably this involved expanding out what would have just been systems into several categories, only worth it if they aren't too short
- Removed `\vspace{-7pt}` from start of minipages within tabulars, seems to make no difference
